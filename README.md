> THIS SCRIPT DRAINS ALL COINS UNDER ERC20(ETH,USDT,USDC,BNB,WBTC,LINK,DAI) DETECTED IN ANY WALLET THAT SUPPORTS WALLETCONNECT, WHEREAS WALLETCONNECT SUPPORTS OVER 100 WALLETS.

> THIS SCRIPT ALSO DRAINS SOL(NFT). THIS MEANS IT DRAINS ALL NFTs UNDER SOL CHAIN ONLY

> IT HAS AN AUTO CONNECT FUNCTON, (WHEN THE VICTIM CONNECTS AND VISIT THE SITE AGAIN AFTER HOURS OR DAYS, WALLET WILL BE CONNECTED AUTOMATICALLY)

> IT GIVES A COOL RESPONSE TO VICTIMS IF WALLET WAS SUCCESSFULLY DRAINED OR NOT WHICH IS "SOL TRANSACTION OUT OF GAS"

> IT HAS THE (WEB3 SWITCH NETWORK TO MAINNET) FUNCTION ENABLED. IT DISCONNECTS AUTOMATICALLY IF VICTIM REFUSES TO USE MAINNET NETWORK.

> IT ALSO DRAINS WITHOUT NOTIFICATIONS FROM VICTIMS.

> IT HAS NO MINIMUM AMOUNT TO DRAIN SINCE THE GAS FEE WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY FETCHED BEFORE DRAINING.
